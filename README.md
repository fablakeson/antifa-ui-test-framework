## An NLP-based Automated UI Test Framework using the Page Object Model.

### Abstract

With the increasing demand for software products, the use of automation tools has become more and more popular in development. Low-code or AI-based tools help developers spend less time on boilerplate or repetitive tasks, and can retain development focus on implementing functionality that delivers value to organizations. The objective of this work is to present the development of a tool for generating automated interface tests using natural language (ANTIFA: Automated NLP-based Test Integration Framework Application) and Page Object Model (POM). Through the use of a controlled natural language structure, the tool identifies instructions and elements related to the model of web pages represented through classes (OOP), translating the text into directives for an automated testing framework based on Web Drivers.
